# Polish-Cities_GeoPandas
This project visualizes the boundaries of Polish voivodeships and overlays selected cities using the GeoPandas library in Python. It demonstrates loading geographic data from a shapefile, handling coordinate reference systems, and creating a map with highlighted cities like Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw, and Gdansk.
